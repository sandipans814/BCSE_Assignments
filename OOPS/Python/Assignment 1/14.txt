Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.
One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. 
She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. 
Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. 
Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old.
She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.
